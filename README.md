# SIMPLI: Single-cell Identification from Multiplexed Images

SIMPLI: Single-cell Identification from Multiplexed Images is a image processing pipeline for the analysis of highly multiplexed histological imaging data. It performs measurements of areas positive for user defined combination of markers and single-cell data analysis. The single cell data analysis includes: cell segmentation, expression based cell type identification and unsupervised clustering.
